# brain-tumor-detection-using-vgg19
This project demonstrates the use of VGG19, a deep convolutional neural network, for classifying brain MRI images as either tumorous or non-tumorous. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the model achieves high accuracy even on relatively small datasets, making it a practical approach for early brain tumorÂ detection.
